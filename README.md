## About me
I'm a Python Developer with over two years of professional experience in building data analysis tools and engineering applications.  
I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics (Photonics specialization)** and I’ve completed coursework for a **Master’s in Computer Science** at Warsaw University of Technology — currently finalizing my thesis.  

During my studies I dedicated a lot of time to **AI/ML and computer vision**, working with tools such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenCV.  
In my professional career I’ve mainly developed **backend applications and GUIs in Python**, using technologies like Django, FastAPI, SQL (PostgreSQL), SQLAlchemy, and PyQt5.  

I enjoy combining my engineering background with programming skills to create practical, user-oriented solutions.  
My experience covers both **machine learning projects** (classification, computer vision, data processing) and **general software development** (object-oriented programming, databases, APIs, unit testing).
