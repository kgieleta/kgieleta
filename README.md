## About me
I'm a Python Developer with two years of professional experience in building data analysis tools and engineering applications.  
I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics (Photonics specialization)** and I’ve completed coursework for a **Master’s in Computer Science** at Warsaw University of Technology — currently finalizing my thesis.  

I enjoy combining my engineering background with programming skills to create practical, user-oriented solutions.  
My experience covers both machine learning projects and general software development.  

During my studies I dedicated a lot of time to **AI/ML and computer vision**, working with tools such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenCV.  
In my professional career I’ve mainly developed **backend applications and GUIs in Python**, using technologies like Django, FastAPI, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and PyQt5.  

I’m motivated by challenges and the opportunity to keep learning, always aiming to refine my skills and apply them in practice.

**Tech stack:**  

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++  
- **Backend & Web Development:** Django, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- **Desktop Applications:** PyQt5  
- **Data Analysis & Processing:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTest, Pydantic  
- **Machine Learning & AI:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, OpenCV, XGBoost, SVM, Isolation Forest, PCA, SMOTE  
- **Tools & Workflow:** Git, Docker
